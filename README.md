# DailyTaskScheduler

A Work Day Scheduler Web App, 



that allows users to save events or tasks and location to a time slot.
the data is cached in localstorage, so on reload the data is persistent.

the time slots will change color based on the time: red for past time, green for current time and grey for future time slots.

if there is an event on the current time slot, a notification banner will appear with the event.
